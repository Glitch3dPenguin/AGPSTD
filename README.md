The Arduino GPS Tracking Device
==============================

This is a small Arduino Project that I have been working on that I wanted to share with the Arduino Community. It is designed to be placed somewhere and then retreived later. Then you remove the SD card from the SD Card Sheild and insert it into your computer. Once this has been done you can covert the text file into a format readable by Google Earth. Open the file in Google Earth and you will be able to see the entire trip that the device took.

**NOTE** 
I will be adding more info soon.
